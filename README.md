# Weather Forecast Command Line Tool

## Purpose

A command line tool to obatin the current weather forecast from a command prompt
or shell. 

Written in Go (Golong) so should compile and run on Windows, macOS, Linux, 
FreeBSD, etc. Program is being written and developed on a Raspberry Pi 4B from
an iPad Pro via Blink Shell.

Project has been created for personal use - so no big budget development team
is involved, so progress will be sporadic I expect... ðŸ˜³

## Project Status

Early development. 

Manual entry of longitude and latitide cordintates will be required in 
the `getURL.go` file if you wish to play with the program.

## Build

Download (clone) the repo to your computer, and run: `make` or `go build` should 
work as well.

Dependancies to build include Go, and Make if prefered. Pre built binary versions 
 will be made available at a later date.

Further help to be added here as development progresses.
